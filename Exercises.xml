                     This is a balanced hand.  16 points and no distirbution points.  Therefore, bid 1 NT.
  
 
                  </explanationpart1>
 <explanationpart2>
A balanced hand WILL contain cards in all four suits (so your hand will contain cards in each of the suits – spaces, hearts, diamonds AND clubs).
 
A balanced hand will NOT contain a void (no cards in a suit).
 
A balanced hand will NOT contain a singleton -(just one card in a suit).
 
A balanced hand CAN contain only ONE doubleton.
  
A balanced hand CAN contain a 5 card suit.
                 </explanationpart2>
<explanationpart3>
 
Remember: The patterns for a balanced hand are:  4-3-3-3, 4-5-3-2, 5-3-3-2 and  1 NT is bid with 15-17 points and a balanced hand.

                     This is a balanced hand.  There are 12 hcp and 1 distribution point (for the 5 card run in Spades).    Therefore, bid 1 Spade.
                     
                     Even though this is a balanced hand, there are not 15-17 points so you cannot bid 1 NT, but there are just enough (13) points to open.

                     This is a balanced hand.  There are 16 high card points and 1 distribution points for a total of 17 points.
                                        
                      You may be tempted to bid Spades, but that would imply you have 13-21 points with an unbalanced hand.  You have a balanced hand with 17 points, so you 
need to communicate that to your partner.

                     This is an unbalanced hand.  There are 14 hcp and 2 distribution points (1 each for the two 5 card runs in Spades and Hearts).

                     Though there are 15-17 points, you cannot bid 1 NT because this hand is unbalanced.

                     With no five-card suit, open a minor suit.  With a choice of three-card minor suits, open the lower-ranking.  Bid 1 Club.

                 <explanationpart3>
                       To remember what to bid in minor suits with 4 of each or 3 of each, use this trick:  Diamonds have 4 sides, Clubs have 3 parts.  So if you have 4 of both, bid Diamonds.  If you have 3 of both, bid Clubs.
                       If you have 4 of one and 3 of the other, bid the one with 4.

                     This is an unbalanced hand.  There are 11 hcp and 2 distribution points (1 for the 5 card run in Spades, and 1 more for the 5 card run in Clubs).

                     With enough to open the bidding and a hand containing two five-card suits, open the higher suit, 1 Spade.

                     You might think the clubs are stronger, but it is harder to make game in Clubs.  In any case the rule
                     is to open the higher of two suits when they both are the same length if 5 or more.

         <description>
                             When your partner opens the bidding at 1 NT, you as a responder know that the opener has 15,16,17 HCP (the opener does not consider distribution points when opening NT).
               By adding your strength to that of the opener's, you can usually tell whether the partnership has at least 25 combined points, enough for a game contract, or fewer than 15 combined points.
               enough only for a partscore contract.

                     points needed for a game contract.  Responder passes because responder knows the contract should be a partscore.

                     With 9 total points, responder knows the combined strength is either 24,25 or 26.   The responder
                     will need more information from opener before deciding whether the partnership should be in game.

                 <explanationpart2>
                      A bid of 2NT is an invitation to the opener to decide to go to game or not, because the opener knows that the responder
                      would have jumped to 3NT if the minimum of 25 points was guaranteed.   With this invitation, the opener would rebid to 3NT if the opener had 16 or 17 points.
                      2NT also tells the opener the responder has a balanced hand.

                     Remember that the opener of 1 NT shows one of the following hand patterns (4-3-3-3,4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2).  When opener
                     bids 1NT, opener promises at least two cards in each suite (and usually 3 cards).

                 Responder has a six-card Spade suite, Opener has at least 2 spades, so responder can be sure there is a Golden Fit
                 with at least 8 Spades and at least 26 points (only 25 is needed for game)
                 </explanationpart2>

So responder jumps to game with 4 spades

                     Remember that the opener of 1 NT shows one of the following hand patterns (4-3-3-3,4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2).  When opener
                     bids 1NT, opener promises at least two cards in each suite (and usually 3 cards).

                 <explanationpart2>
                 Responder has a five-card Heart suite, Opener has at least 2 Hearts, so responder cannot be sure there is a Golden Fit
                 as there may be only 7 Heart cards.   Therefore the responder must invite the opener to decide if there is enough.	
                 </explanationpart2>
                 <explanationpart3>
                   There are enough points for a game, but only if there are 8 or more hearts.
                   If the opener only had 2 hearts, the opener would probably respond with 3NT to get into game.

                     Remember that a bid of 2NT means 8-9 points, and 3 or 4 of a suit means 10 or more points.
                     So by staying at the 2 level, you are telling the opener that you have 7 or less points.

                 You know you belong in a partscore, because your total combined points are not more than 21 (17+4), so play in your Golden Fit.

                     With only a four-card suit, it is unlikely there is a Golden Fit  Opener will have 4 or more diamonds less than half the time.

                     With 9 points, you can't rule out the possibility of a game contract.
                     You don't have enough points, however, to bid game without further information
                     from opener.

                  The opener will jump to 3NT if the opener has 17 points since you are promising 8 points with your 2NT bid.
                  The opener might pass at 2NT with 15 or 16 points.

                     With 12 total points, you know you want to play in game because you have at least 26 points between you (the opening bid of 1NT promsed 15-17 points).
                     The opener has at least 2 Spades and thus you have at least 8 Spades between you - a Golden Fit.

                   You have 11 total points, enough for game.  With only two cards in each major, there is no possibility
                   of a Golden Fit in a major suit.  Though you could have a Golden Fit in a minor suit (Diamonds), there would be a need for a total
                   point count of 29.   The maximum you have between you is 28 (17 + 11).  A no trump game is the mostly likely winning scenario.

                  This is a stopping bid.  The opener will not rebid higher.  Even if they have 17 points and you had 15 points, 32 is not enough for a small slam
                  so there is no point in bidding higher than game.

                 With 13 total points and a five-card major suit, you want to play game at 4 Hearts and should do so
                 if opener has three or more; otherwise you want to end bidding at 3NT.  
                 
                 By bidding 3 Hearts, the opener knows you have 10 or more points and thus should probably be in game, at least 
                 with 3NT (10+15=25 points).  Opener knows you don't have 0-7 points, or you would have bid only 2 Hearts with 
                 five Hearts. Opener knows you don't have 8-9 points because you would have bid 2NT.  Since you didn't jump
                 to 4 Hearts (for game) opener knows you must not have 6 Hearts.

                 With 10 total points and a four-card major suit, you cannot be sure of a Golden Fit in Spades because
                 the opener has only promised 2 Spades.  You don't have the room to explore if opener has 3 Spades, but
                 you do have at least 25 points (15+10) between you ... enough for a game in NT.

                With 10 total points and a four-card major suit, you could use the Stayman convention (2 Clubs)
                 to ask if openr has a four-card major.  However, assuming you don't know about Stayman, bid 3NT.

                  This is a stopping bid.  The opener has not need to bid higher than game.

                 Responder bid 2 Spades.  This means responder has a maximum of 7 points and is telling
                 you that responder has at least 5 spades.  Even though your spades are looking very strong, you don't 
                 have enough for game (17+7-or-less), so you can't bid more Spades.  Partner has made a sign-off bid
                 and expects you to pass.

                 Responder has 8 or 9 points.  If you have 15, then 23 is not enough for game, so you would pass.
                 If you have 16 you have 24 which is still not enough for game so you would pass.
                 But you have 17 points, so beween you you have 25 or 26 points.  Enough for game in NT.

                 By bidding 3 Hearts the responder is telling you that they have 5 Heart cards and 10-15 points.
                Since you have 3 Hearts, you have a Golden Fit with 8 Hearts and at least 25 points.

                     A new-suit bid by you would be forcing and this might get the partnership too high
                     as you may have only 16 points between you.

                     With 9 total points, your priority is to find and support a major suit.  But you cannot support Spades.
                     
                     Also, with 6-9 total points, you may bid a new suit, but only at the 1 level (a new suit at the 2 level would be forcing)
                     Since your partner opened with Spades, you don't have the strength to go to the 2 level.
                     
                     Your options with 6-9 points are, in order (1) Raise partner's major suit to the two level with at least three-card support, (2) Bid a new suit at the one level), or (3) Bid 1NT)

                     Note the the 1NT response does not promise a balanced hand.  It simply indicates there are enough total points
                     to keep the bidding going but not other bid to make.

                     You know there is a Golden Fit in Hearts since partner's opening bid shows at 
                     least 5 Hearts.  You have 6 high card points and 1 point for the doubletom in Spades, a total of 7 points.
                     
                	Your options with 6-9 points are, in order (1) Raise partner's major suit to the two level with at least three-card support, (2) Bid a new suit at the one level), or (3) Bid 1NT)

                     This is a minimal hand.  This is an invitational bid.  If the opener has a minimum hand (near 13) the opener will pass.
                     With additional strength, opener may bid again.

                   You can't support spades or bid a new suit at the one level.  The Hearts are attractive but you don't have enough 
                   strength to go to the two level.  The only choice left is 1NT.

                 <explanationpart2>
                                     Unlike an opening bid of 1NT, a response of 1 NT does not describe a balanced hand.  Instead it shows a minimum hand of 6-9 points.

                     When responding to a 1 bid of a major suit, your priorities are to (1) Raise you partner's major suit to the two level with at least three-card support.
                     (2) Bid a new suite at the 1 level
                     (3) Bid 1 NT

                     (1) Bid your longest suit

                  With support for the opener's major suit, responder sees 11 total points and can bid 3 Spades.  This invitational bid
                  tells the opener that (A) there is support for Spades, there is not enough points to commit to game but enough to explore for game 
                  (as a 2 Spade bid would have communicated only 6-9 points).

                             If the opener has a minimum hand of 13 points, the opener would pass and play
                  in a part score. With more, opener can bid to game.

                  Responder can't support opener's major but does have a suit that is biddable.  With 11 total points,
                  responder has enough strength to bid at the two level and may respond 2 Hearts.

                 <explanationpart2>
                            Because the responder has not previously passed and 2 Hearts is a new-suit bid, its forcing and opener
                            will have to bid again.

                Responder knows there are enough points for a game contract.  As captain, responder must make sure the partnership
                does not stop below the level of game.  If responder bids below the level of game, make sure your bid is a forcing bid (eg: Change of suit)

                              With 15 total points (includes 1 point for the doubleton Heart), responder could support opener's spades,
                              but 15 total points is too much to raise to the 3 level.  A raise to the 4 level would stop the bidding at game and wouldn't
                              leave room to explore the possibility for a slam contract.

                   Opener has 11 HCP plus 2 points fo rhte six-card suit.   Responder's raise is invitational, indicating 6-9 points.

                   With 13 points in hand, and a maximum of 9 points in the partner's hand, there is no more than 21 points.
                   As this is not enough combined strength for game, Opener passes.

                 <explanationpart2>
                   This is a medium hand (16-18 points).  With some extra strength, opern moves higher on the bidding scale to three Spades.
                  
                 </explanationpart2>
                 <explanationpart3>
                 The decision as to whether there is enough combined strength for game will be left to the responder.  If the responder has
                 6 or 7 total points, there won't be enough, but with 8 or 9 total points, responder will raise to 4 Spades (game!)

                   Opener has 21 total points.  This is a maximum hand (19-21 total points) for a 1 suit opener.
                   With this much extra strength, oper can jump one level on the bidding scale and rebid 4 Spades putting the partnership in game.

                       With 13 total points plus 2 points for the six-card suti, opener has enough to accept the invitation (15 for opener and 9 - 11 for responder = 24-26)

                  Opener bids 4 Hearts.  There is no need to bid another suit, since the suit has already been decided.

                 <explanationpart3>
                      When responder raises opener's major suit to the three level, promising 9-11 points, opener passes with a minimum 13 but
                      bids game with 14 or more.  Actually, 14 points only works if responder has 11 points, not 10 total points.  Unfortunately,
                      the opener cannot find out through the bidding if reponder has 10 or 11 points.  But, in this case, opener proceeds to game
                      based on the "quality" of the hand.  This is a subtle difference.

                  Opener has not extra strength and will pass, leaving partnership in a partscore.  Even if responder has as much as 9 total points,
                  there won't be enough combined strength for game.

                  With some extra strength, opener moves higher on the bidding scale to 3 Diamonds.  The decision
                  on whether or not there is enough combined strength for game will be left to the responder.

                  If responder has only 6 or 7 totl poitns, there won't be enough conbined strength for gam (29 points) and will pass.
                  If responder has at least 8 total points, the partnership should have enough for the Golden Game in 3NT.

                       With 19 HCP, this is a  maximum hand (19-21) total points).

                  With this much additional strength, opener wants to be in game and jump to 3NT, the Golden Game, rather than 5 Diamonds.
                   Unless reponder had the maximum of 10 total points, it is unlikely there will be enought combined strength for a 5 Diamonds contract.

                 The jump rebid to 3 NT is called a "Jump shift", this means "jumping" level and "shifting" the strain/suit to a new one not previously
                 mentioned in the bidding.
                 
                 When responder raises opener's minor suit to the three level, opener passes with  13 points, but bids game (3NT) with 14 or more.

                     Opener (North) knows there is no Golden Fit in hearts because responder would have raised to 2 Hearts with three or more.  Since the 
                     contract is already in No Trump and opener has not extra strength, best action is to pass.

                       The partnership probably can't make game since responder has a maximum of 9 points.

                       Remember, if the responder bids 1 NT, it means they have 6-9 points and no support (2 cards or less) for the major.  A 2NT bid would have meant the responder has 13-15 points with two or fewer of the major opening.

                     Opener (North) has 13 total points.  The hand is unbalanced, since operner has a singleton club.   To finish 
                     describing the hand, opener rebids 2 Diamonds, showing a second suit.

                     Opener (North) has 14 total points including 2 for the six card suit.
                     Opener's hand is unbalanced and there is no second suit to show.  Opener rebids the original suit of 2 Hearts

                      The rebid of the heart suit after a 1 NT bid by responder definately shows a six card suit.

                     Opener has a minimum hand of 14 total points.   Opener has a second suit, Spades, which might be shown.
                     There are two reasons, however, why opener should not suit this suit.  First, if opener bids 2 Spades to show the second
                     suit and an unbalanced hand, responder will have to choose between Spades and Hearts.  If responder prefers Hearts, responder
                     must bid 3 Hearts and, with both partners having minimum hands, the partnership may be to high on the Bidding Scale.
                     Second, opener knows there can't be a Golden Fit in Spades since responder would have bid 1 Sapd with for or more Spades rather
                     than NT.
                  </explanationpart1>
                 <explanationpart2>
                      Opener should rebid the orginal suit, 2 Hearts and this should end the bidding.
                 </explanationpart2>
                 <explanationpart3>
                        Remember, if the responder bids 1 NT, it means they have 6-9 points and no support (2 cards or less) for the major.

                     Opener has a medium hand of 16 HCP plus 2 points for the six-cards suit, totalling 18 points.  
                     Opener has unblanced hand with no second suit.  To describe the shape of the hand, opener must rebid the original suit.
                     With extra strength opener does not rebid the suit at the two level as opener would be holding a minimum strength hand.
                     Instead, opener jumps to the three level and bids 3 Diamonds.

                     Opener has a medium hand of 16 HCP plus 1 points for the five-cards suit, totalling 17 points.  
                     Opener has unblanced hand and has a possible second suit.  
                     Opener can show this by bidding the second suit at the 2 level to tell responder this is an unbalanced hand with at least five diamonds and four hearts
                     Opener is also showing a medium strength hand by gidding a higher ranking suit at the two level.

                     Opener has a medium hand of 16 HCP plus 1 points for the five-cards suit, totalling 17 points.  
                     Opener has unblanced hand and has a possible second suit but the second suit is lower than the opener's original suit.
                     Opener describes the hand by rebidding 2 Clubs.

                 <explanationpart2>
                      This shows an unbalanced hand.  It will sound exactly the same to responder as if the operner has a minimum-strength hand with diamonds and clubs.
                      Unfortuantely, there is no way around this.  If opener jumps to 3 Clubs to show the extra strength, the partnership might get too high on the Bidding Scale.

                    With a balanced hand with 18 or 19 HCP in hand, the opener will begin the bidding with one of a suit and make a jump rebid (jump shift) to notrump.
                    If reponder shows 6 to 9 total points, the partnership has enough strength for game.

                      This is a maximum strength had with a second suit that can be shown.  To show this, opener rebids 3 Diamonds.
                      This jump-shift is a forcing bid by opener describing a maximum-strength unbalanced hand.  Responder will use
                      this information to determine the final contract.

                     Opener has a minimum hand strength with 13 total points.
                     With a balanced hand, opener can simply raise to game at 3 NT.

                       The opener (East) shows a minimum-strength hand by rebidding 1NT at the cheapest available level.

                 Opener shows a minimum hand (with 1NT rebid), but opener is indicating there are 4 Spades, responder knows there is a Golden Fit in Spades.
                 With only 8 total points, responder wants the partnership to play in a partscore and bids 2 Spades.

                 Since opener shows a minimum hand (with 1NT rebid), responder knows there is a Golden Fit in Diamonds.
                 With only 9 total points, responder wants the partnership to play in a partscore and bids 2 Diamonds.
                 
                   Returning to the ppening bid is a signoff bid, telling opener to pass.

                    Note that the responder considered Dummy points, rather than Distribution points, since the responder will end up being the Dummy.

           Responder initially values this hand as 6 HCP.  
           When opener bids 1 Club, reponder looks for a Golden Fit by bidding 1 Heart (up the line).
           When opener rebids 1 Spade, responder knows there is a Golden Fit in a major suit.
           Responder now values the hand using dumming points.  
           This brings the total to 7 points - 6 HCP plus 1 point for the doubleton club.
           The hand is still minimum category, and responder knows the partnership belongs in a partscore.

                 Opener could have a minimum- or medium-strength hand. It is safer for responder to assume opener has a minimum hand and choose a rebid accordingly.

           Even knowing there is a Golden Fit in clubs when opener starts the bidding with 1 Club, responder's first bid is 1 Heart.
           Responder is looking for a Golden Fit in a major suit.
           Opener's rebid has told responder that there is not Golden Fit in a major suit.
           Responder nows signs off in 2 Clubs, putting the partnership in a partscore in its Golden Fit.

           With 7 HCP, responder wants to stop in partscore in a Golden Fit.
           There is no Spade fit because opener did not raise responder's suit.
           Since opener has an unbalanced hand with diamonds that are equal in length or longer than clubs, the most likely Golden Fit is in Diamonds, opener's original suit, rather than in Clubs.

                 Opener could have a minimum- or medium-strength hand. It is safer for responder to assume opener has a minimum hand and choose a rebid accordingly.

Responder has a hand worth 7 total points — 6 HCP plus 1 point for the five-card suit. Responder knows, therefore, that the partnership doesn’t have enough combined strength for game.

                 Responder would pass.

          If responder has 6 or 7 total points, the partnership belongs in a partscore since opener’s maximum is 18 total points. 
          Unless opener has exactly 18 total points and responder has exactly 7 total points (a possibility that will be ignored for simplicity’s sake), the partnership will have
          fewer than 25 combined total points. Therefore, responder wants to sign off in the best partscore.
          This would be done either by (A) Passing, or (B) bidding a suit  already mentioned by the partnership at the cheapest available level.
